# Portfolio & tech articles

After long consideration, I decided to separate my personal blog from all the tech-related stuff. 
I'm planning to drift away from the software development field, but until this happens I'll keep all 
the projects I build and tutorials/guides/articles I write here. 

## IMPORTANT Note

This site is not created to be a template or theme, but for my own use. Feel free to use it too, 
but keep in mind that I will not provide support or guidance for doing that.

I highly recommend you check [the original theme I used](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack) and start from there.

This site is based on the [Hugo Theme Stack](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack) by [Jimmy Cai](https://github.com/CaiJimmy) 
with a bit of modifications and customizations on top of it.
